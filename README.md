Updated April 2023

Due to the study of medical statistics this semester, 
in order to further expand the knowledge of statistics, 
the author has organized the statistical codes shared by Professor Li.

Thanks again to Prof. Li for his selfless sharing of the code!

This course combines the principles of statistical and data analysis with Python to explain and practice, covering most of the statistical & data analysis models, especially the more mainstream algorithms: parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, generalized linear regression, nonlinear models, Lasso, ridge regression, generalized additive models, orthogonal polynomial models, regression spline, etc.; one-way and two-way ANOVA; Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis, Typical Correlation Analysis, Cluster Analysis, etc., which are often used in machine learning; Various non-parametric statistical models, including non-parametric statistical inference, scale inference, location inference, analysis of linked-table data and attribute data, log-linear and quantile regression models, non-parametric kernel density estimation, and non-parametric regression.

## DIC_test
Updated December 2023

An animal experiment assignment on DIC(disseminated intravascular coagulation)

The independent two-sample t-test was used to examine the APPT, 
PT and FIB indices in the experimental and control groups.

- PT (Prothrombin Time): mainly reflects the status of the exogenous coagulation pathway and the common coagulation pathway. the activators added to the PT test include tissue factor (TF) and calcium ions (Ca2+), so the prolongation of the PT is usually indicative of a lack of coagulation factors (e.g., VII, X, II, V, I) in the exogenous pathway or the common pathway or a lack of activity.

- APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time): mainly reflects the status of the endogenous coagulation pathway and the common coagulation pathway. activators added to the APTT test include phospholipids (PL) and calcium ions (Ca2+), so prolongation of the APTT is usually indicative of a lack of coagulation factors in the endogenous pathway (e.g., XII, XI, IX, VIII) or of low activity. ..

- TT (prothrombin time): mainly reflects the status of fibrinogen conversion in the common coagulation pathway. thrombin is added directly to the TT assay, so prolongation of the TT usually suggests that the amount or function of fibrinogen is abnormal, or that anti-fibrinogen antibodies are present.
