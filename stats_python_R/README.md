The medical statistics course studied this semester covered a limited amount of statistical content. This article summarizes the core concepts and particular aspects of that subject.

# Statistics
What's the **Statistics**?
- Stat -> State
- A science dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of masses  of numerical data -- Webster's International Dictionary
- The **science and art** of dealing with variation in data through collection, classification and analysis in such a way as to obtain reliable results -- Last JM

**Sampling error**: It is the difference between sample statistics and population parameters caused by random sampling, resulting from individual variability and sampling.

## Research Methods:

- **Observational research (also kown as survey study)**
    - _Descriptive research_: It is purely observational and aims to describe a behavior or type of outcome.
        - **Cross-Sectional Study**: It examines the relationship between diseases (or other health-related characteristics) and other variables of interest as they exist in a defined population at a single point in time.
            - **Example in Medicine**: Survey studies about lifestyle factors and disease prevalence in a population.
        - **Example in Medicine (non cross-sectional)**: Documenting symptoms in patients newly diagnosed with a rare disease for which there is, as yet, no understanding.
    - _Analytical research (Also known as relational research)_: It suggests a hypothesis and looks at the impact of one factor on another.
        - **Case-Control Study**: Case-control study is a kind of observational study where two existing groups varying in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute.
            - **Example in Medicine**: Looking at lung cancer patients and seeing if they are more likely to have been smokers.
        - **Cohort Study**: It involves identification of two groups (cohorts) of patients, one which did receive the exposure of interest, and one which did not, and following these cohorts forward for the outcome of interest
            - **Example in Medicine**: Tracking a group of heavy smokers and a group of non-smokers over time to see if the incidence of lung cancer is higher in the smoking group.
- **Experimental research (Also known as interventional research)**
    - _Randomized Controlled Trial_: Participants are randomly allocated into an experimental group or a control group.
        - **Example in Medicine**: A group of patients are randomized to either an experimental drug or a placebo to see the effect on disease outcomes.
    - _Non-randomized Controlled Trial_: Participants are allocated into an experimental group or a control group, but not at random.
        - **Example in Medicine**: Patients at one clinic are given a new supplement for heart health while patients at a similar clinic are not.

**The Order of Observational Study**
- **Starts with a descriptive study**, such as a cross-sectional study, to gather initial information about the population.
- **Followed by an analytical study**, like the case-control or cohort study, to delve deeper into relationships between variables.
    - **Case-Control Study** (also known as retrospective study): It starts with the outcome (such as a disease) and then traces back to investigate the exposure.
    - **Cohort study**: This could be either prospective or retrospective. In a prospective cohort study, researchers first identify the factor of interest and then observe the outcome over time. In a retrospective cohort study, researchers start by looking backwards and examining the exposure to a risk factor in relation to an outcome that has already been established.

key words: Observation Study; Descriptive Study; Analytical Study; Cross-Sectional Study; Case-control Study; Cohort Study 

> Please note that observational studies often cannot establish causal relationships because there may exist unknown or uncontrolled confounding variables. They are more oriented towards describing and identifying correlations.

>In contrast, experimental studies (especially randomized controlled trials) are more likely to infer causal relationships because of their random assignment in design and control over potential confounding factors, provided that the experiment is appropriately designed and executed.

## Sampling
- **Simple random sampling**: Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This is like a lottery system.
    - **Example**: In a research study to evaluate the prevalence of diabetes, we might randomly select 1000 individuals from a population database which contains all citizens of a city.
- **Systematic sampling**: Members from a larger population are selected according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval (known as the sampling interval).
    - **Example**: In a clinic, every 10th patient entering the clinic might be selected for a survey on health habits.
- **Stratified sampling**: The population is divided into strata (grouped based on a certain characteristic), and random samples are taken from each strata. This can increase the precision of the sample without adding more cost.
    - **Example**: In a study to understand health behavior in different age groups, the population might be divided into age-related strata, and individuals could be randomly selected from each stratum.
- **Cluster sampling**: The population is divided into clusters (grouped based on a certain geographical area or time period), and random samples are taken from these clusters. The entire cluster is then surveyed.
    - **Example**: In a research study evaluating vaccination rates, researchers might divide the city into different clusters (according to district), and then randomly select certain clusters to conduct a detailed survey of all residents.

Each method has unique advantages and disadvantages. Simple random sampling is easy and straightforward but might not be feasible for large populations. Systematic sampling is slightly more complex but still easy to implement. Stratified sampling can provide more representative samples when there are major differences in characteristics within a population. Finally, cluster sampling can reduce costs when the population is large and spread out geographically, but it might introduce more sampling error compared to other methods. The best method to use depends on the available resources and the nature of the population and research question.

A multistage sampling is suggested!
