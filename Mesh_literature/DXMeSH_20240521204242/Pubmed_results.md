In contrast, the cells of the placental mesenchyme are thought to arise from the inner cell mass, but the details of this process are limited.

This polarization is mediated through activation of Akt/signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) sign |2018 |06    |04  |Cell Death Dis                           |Cell death &amp; disease                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |Abortion, Spontaneous; Animals; Decidua; Enzyme Activation; Female; Humans; Immune Tolerance; Interferon Regulatory Factors; Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases; Macrophages; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred CBA; Mice, Inbred DBA; Pregnancy; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; RANK Ligand; Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B; STAT6 Transcription Factor; Signal Transduction; Stromal Cells; Th2 Cells; Trophoblasts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |Meng                                |Yu-Han           |Laboratory for Reproductive Immunology, Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fudan University Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, People's Republic of China                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |NA                                        |

Unlike conventional alphabeta T cells that recognize peptides in the context of MHC molecules, NKT cells recognize  |2008 |11    |17  |Immunol Invest                           |Immunological investigations                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |Abortion, Spontaneous; Animals; Antigens, CD1; Female; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Killer Cells, Natural; Lymphocyte Activation; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Placenta; Placental Circulation; Pregnancy; T-Lymphocyte Subsets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |Boyson                              |J E              |Department of Surgery, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont 05405, USA. jboyson@uvm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |jboyson@uvm.edu                           |

In addition, trophoblast is not sensible to lysis by NK cells, TNF-alpha or macrophages, but m |2005 |02    |24  |Med Hypotheses                           |Medical hypotheses                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |Abortion, Habitual; Calcitriol; Down-Regulation; Female; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Interferon-gamma; Interleukin-2; Models, Immunological; Pregnancy; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |Bubanovic                           |I                |Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics--MEDICA CENTER--Novosadska 1/c, 18000 Nis, Serbia and Montenegro. ibubanovic@yahoo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |ibubanovic@yahoo.com                      |
